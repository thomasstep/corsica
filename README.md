# Background

This is a web app made for the Viasat hackathon that I participated in. The app is made in React + Redux. I modified a code base that achieved something similar to what I wanted to do.

# Corsica

Start the app with:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should be run in tandem with Corsica Movie Server.
